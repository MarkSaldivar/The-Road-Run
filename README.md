# The-Road-Run

Game By: I Don't Know, I'm Not Perfect At Making Team Names (I.D.K.I.N.P.A.M.T.N)

The Road Run is a side scrolling platform game where you play as "Roddy Road Runner" (not Rowdy... different bird. I asked). Anyway, Roddy is late to class and it's your job to help him dodge traffic and students to get to class on time. 

So choose your difficulty and get to class, you're late! Submit your score to the scoreboard and compete against friends and family for the highest score! 

# How to Play
After running the project in Eclipes, select the "Play" button to start the game. Once you select the "Play" button, you will be brought to a screen where you can select your difficulty.

  \-Easy: Is really really easy, obstacle spawns and movement are really slow.
  
  \-Medium: This is a good pace for the game, obstacle spawns and movement are significantly faster.
  
  \-Hard: This is probably the best difficulty to play the game with. "Hard" is not really super hard, just faster/more frequent obstacle spawning.
    
   
    
After selecting a difficulty, you will be brought into the game. The only control for the game is the Spacebar to jump. Once in the air, you can hold the Spacebar for a short glide which might be useful.

Your objective is to jump over incoming obstacles like cars and people. You are free to land on top of obstacles, but you will lose the game if you get hit by an obstacle. Every obstacle that you jump over, you will get a point.

After you lose a game, you will be able to submit your score to the scoreboard, or retry for a better score.



--Note: Currently there is a bug where if you select "Easy" difficlty, you will need to restart the game if you wish to play in "Medium" or "Hard" difficulty.

# Future State

On top of fixing some of the little bugs and roughness around the edges, this game has a lot of potenital to expand.

One idea that was passed around was to create scalable / dyanmic terrain and different levels.

\-Having billboards / exit signs that the player can jump on top of using a lower platform like a car to get to the higher platforms. This would give variety in terrain and playstyle.

\-obstacles could also spawn from the left side of the screen, forcing the player to be aware of incoming obstacles from behind.

\-Different levels with different themes would be cool too.
